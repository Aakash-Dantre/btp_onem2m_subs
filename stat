hello sir,
we have implmented the server in django, which is storing contianers instances into postgress db

but django is taking more time as compared to http-server for some dummy request

django takes around 4 sec per 50 requests
http-server takes around 0.2 sec per 50 requests

Although when request are send through onem2m subscription, it takes 5 sec for both, as the process is bottlenecked by container creation.



how should we proceed furthur on this?
